To process 25GB of data in spark:
a. How many CPU cores are required to process 25GB of data?
By default, spark creates one partition for each block of the file (block is of 128mb in HDFS).
Converting value in GB to MB:
25GB = 25 * 1024 MB = 25600 MB.

Total number of partitions = total size of data/ size of each partition = 25600/128 = 200

Number of cores = Number of Partitions.
Therefore, 200 CPU cores are required to process 25 GB data in PARALLEL.

b. How many executors are required to process 25 GB?
As per the researchers, 2 to 5 is the range of cores for each executor.
We have to do R&D like how is the job behaving, to find the suitable CPU cores for our executor by performing using 2 cores, 3 cores, etc.
Average CPU cores per executor: 4

Total number of executors = total CPU cores/ Avg CPU cores per executor = 200/4 = 50

c. How much each executor memory is required to process 25 GB of data?
Expected memory for each core = minimum 4 times of * (default partition size) = 4*128 MB = 512 MB.
Executor memory should not be less than 1.5 * of spark reserved memory.(single core executor memory should not be les than 450 MB)
Memory for each executor = CPU cores for each executor * memory for each core = 4 * 512 MB = 2 GB
That means if we give 2 GB memory then only it will process 4 task in parallel.
Suppose, if we give 1 GB instead of 2 GB then we have to reduce the number of cores or the job wil get failed.

d. What is total memory required to process 25 GB data?
Total number of executor = 50
Memeory for each executor = 2 GB
Total memory for all executor = 50*2 GB = 100 GB.

Thumb rule:
Data = 25 GB
No. of CPU cores = 4 * data in GB = 4 * 25 = 200 cores.
Total No. of executors = 2 times of Data = 2 * 25 GB = 50 GB.
Memory for each executor = 4 * 512 MB = 2 GB.

Scenario Questions:
1. Suppose we have data of 25 GB to process. If one task is taking 5mins to complete then how much time will it take to complete all tasks?
For 25 GB of data, we have 200 cores and partitions which perform in parallel. so it will take 5mins only.
